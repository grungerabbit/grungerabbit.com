I'm currently attending the [Feast Conference](http://feastongood.com/2013/)! My team won the Health challenge at last weekend's hackathon with our game [Eat With Me](http://eatwithmenow.herokuapp.com/). I will be presenting Eat With Me tonight.

Eat With Me is a game that connects parents and children to learn and talk about healthy food choices. Through trial-and-error, empathy, and adorable pets, kids understand the effects of food on the body.
