#Welcome!

I will be updating this throughout the semester. This is under construction.

*Weekly DesignDays design events are for student hackers, designers, entrepreneurs, and anyone else whoâ€™s feeling saucy! We will think, talk, and do design, technology, and entrepreneurship. The goal of DesignDays is to connect NYC area students with one another. Covering topics from typography to web design and everything else in between.*
